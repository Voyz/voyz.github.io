            question: 'Do you do short projects? I only need a little help, this shouldn\'t take more than a day or two.',

            question: 'Do you work with the XYZ platform/broker?',
            answer: 'The systems I build are broker-agnostic, meaning they can connect to any trading platform. If I haven\'t worked with your broker before, I can adapt to it relatively quickly. Most APIs function similarly, so integrating a new one is usually straightforward.',

            question: 'Whatâ€™s your background?',
            answer: 'I have worked in algorithmic trading since 2019. I specialise in creating bespoke trading systems, focusing on reliability and maintainability. It brings me deep satisfaction to help my clients bring their ideas into fruition and to show the full potential of their strategies. Algorithmic trading, as a field, is full of eager and innovative people who are truly excited about what they do - and I feel I thrive in this setting.<br><br>I authored and maintain two popular libraries for Interactive Brokers API: IBeam and IBind, and two not-so-popular but equally useful libraries: Superloops and Databay.<br><br>Prior to my work in algorithmic trading I was a machine learning researcher, specialising in computer vision and rendering using deep neural networks. Throughout my career I have also done several years of web development, and mobile app development. Before becoming fully remote I worked as workflow optimisation engineer and pipeline developer for a couple of creative animation studios in London.<br><br>I have a masters degree in software engineering for computer graphics and visualisations, and an undergraduate degree in computer visual effects.<br><br>When I don\'t code I travel the world, take nice photos and play music with my loved ones. I\'ve recently settled down after 6 years of living across Asia, Latin America and Europe.',

            question: 'Do you trade yourself?',
